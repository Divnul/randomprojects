# Random projects repo

Just a collection of random projects I've written over the years, as well as a log of stuff I've lost due to moving / getting a new workspace.

Snek and Snek_prev
-
Fun little project I wrote in high school while board with the Delphi work we were doing. I wrote a linked list structure for the snake's dynamic length, and used a paint box and timer for graphics and progressing game state, respectively.
Snek is the last version I wrote, and was showed off at Pretoria North Highschool's opening day in 2022. Snek_prev and a previous version were mostly iterations on graphics, before Snek added mines and walls, too.

CustomChess
-
Woohooo! This one is very interesting to work on, but is currently on hiatus until I get back to writing my custom language (Currently writing a WordPress plugin for a friend). Right now, it purely renders graphics for a board and background,
and supports .bmp and .tga files.

Lost projects
-
-Java snake: A barebone snake game I also wrote in Eclipse IDE with Java.

-2D equation grapher: My 2022 IT PAT Phase 2 could graph a 2D function if given the code to calculate heightmap values. I wanted the user to be able to write the equation themselves at the time, but couldn't get it to evaluate the expression properly.
Although, as you'll see in the random experiments directory, I can now compute expressions using a stack structure after a lot of experimentation.

-Blocky runner: Based in Unity C#, was just a cube running and dodging other cubes with WASD controls
