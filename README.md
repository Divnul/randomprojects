# Random projects repo

Just a collection of random projects I've written over the years, as well as a log of stuff I've lost due to moving / getting a new workspace.

Snek and Snek_prev
-
Fun little project I wrote in high school while board with the Delphi work we were doing. I wrote a linked list structure for the snake's dynamic length, and used a paint box and timer for graphics and progressing game state, respectively.
Snek is the last version I wrote, and was showed off at Pretoria North Highschool's opening day in 2022. Snek_prev and a previous version were mostly iterations on graphics, before Snek added mines and walls, too.

CustomChess
-
Woohooo! This one is very interesting to work on, but is currently on hiatus until I get back to writing my custom language for the project (Currently writing a WordPress plugin for a friend). Right now, it purely renders graphics for a board and background, and supports .bmp and .tga files.

PRG182 Project 2
-
A project I got 100% for, where I messed around with a bunch of C# abstractions and making a more robust input validator along the way as well.

Cryptopal
-
I've recently started working through the cryptopal challenges in C. I cleaned up my folder of all the vim files and uploaded the source code I wrote, and to date have been able to solve set 1 tasks 1 - 6. I'm struggling on getting the rest of the set done because I can't get OpenSSL properly installed, but after finishing the first set, I think I'm going to rewrite this with stream .exe and have every task be a .bat file for a simple solution directory.

Random experiments
-
-Brainfuck interpreter: I wrote interpreters for Brainfuck in both C and C#

-C Data Structures: When I started messing with C, I wrote typeless code for a stack and a dynamic array data structure

-Expression eval: C code capable of calculating basic arithmetic expressions' values and substituting characters if they're included.

-Graph estimator: Sad remnants of an attempt at a neural network that can approximate a 2D equation's line. Written in Windows Forms with height maps, I believe the calculus is correct, but the AI is finding a stupid strategy for lowering the error score.

-Text based game: Abandoned project where I tried to write a text based game based in a dungeon. Has a funny maze generation algorithm, and some incomplete code for a time, stealth and combat system (not functional right now)

-Tictactoe: A bot written in C that uses Minimax to play perfect tic tac toe.

Lost projects
-
-Java snake: A barebone snake game I also wrote in Eclipse IDE with Java.

-2D equation grapher: My 2022 IT PAT Phase 2 could graph a 2D function if given the code to calculate heightmap values. I wanted the user to be able to write the equation themselves at the time, but couldn't get it to evaluate the expression properly.
Although, as you'll see in the random experiments directory, I can now compute expressions using a stack structure after a lot of experimentation.

-Blocky runner: Based in Unity C#, was just a cube running and dodging other cubes with WASD controls
