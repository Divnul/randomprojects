# Custom-Chess
A chess program that allows you to write custom chess variations on the fly in .chess files. All written in visual C.
Uses <windows.h> and libraries as of 9/12 listed here:

-user32.lib
-gdi32.lib

So far(version 0.1):
A simple main.c that reads contents of a background.bmp file and board.bmp file, and draws things appropriately, as well as piece highlights.
Also works with images.h in the Headers directory
